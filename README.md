The purpose of this repository is to explain my favorite aspects of comp20 and what I have learned from the class. My
favorite assignment was assignment 3, it was really interesting to a - very basic - understanding of how servers and
web applications actually work. Although we did not deal much with security or "nitty-gritty" server details, it opened
my eyes to how challenging/difficult/tedious these things can be. One of the biggest things I'm taking away from this 
class is a newfound respect for web developers, it's an entirely different world than comp11 or comp15 with much more
dynamic, interacting pieces that all must operate together with high levels of functionality. I think the most important
thing I learned in this class is how to learn better. More often than not, problems will not present their solutions to you.
It is the individual's job to assess the problem and determine an optimal solution. The ability to learn new things and 
adapt to new situations is one of the most valuable skills a person can have - intellectual vitality might be the word I'm
looking for. 

Now that I've finished the course, I really want to delve deeper into developing applications and tools that other people
can use effortlessly. Although our ride sharing apps were fine for the scope of this class, I argue they're negligibly 
comparable to a real ride-sharing app or any large-scale commercial software for that matter. It's all in the details - 
making an app that works is a whole different ball game than making an app that is perfect (or as perfect as possible) top
to bottom.
