In this lab I correctly set up my private github repository and managed my files properly with correct naming/foldering. I also figured out how to use media queries to create a "responsive" web page that changes the pixels diplayed in a sprite. I created a class for the jpg and created three media queries, one with a max/min width for the cases with width constraints. I made the default sprite the upper left image, when the page is greater than 1200 pixels wide. I did not collaborate with anyone and the lab probably took about two hours to complete.
