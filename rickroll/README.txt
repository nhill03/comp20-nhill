After the final commit, I succesfully created subtitles that appear in the div underneath the video. I did so using javascript, the DOM, and an event listener. I initially had trouble figuring out how to track the video time and check it against when each lyric stanza should appear. I tried using an event listener with the "playing" attribute wrapped in a while loop that checked the times, but this caused the video to lag and/or freeze. I eventually realized that an event listener with a "timeupdate" argument repeatedly returns the current video time, not requiring any type of looping. After realizing this, the solution became very simple. I did not collaborate with anybody on this project. One aspect that was not entirely implemented correctly was the video CSS. I have this weird thing where I really enjoy content that dynamically scales with the viewport, but in this case it makes the webpage format kinda ugly when the browser is really large/fullscreen. I could have just left the video CSS alone, but that's not any fun. Cumulatively I spent approximately 4 hours on this lab (due to frustration figuring out eventlistener).
