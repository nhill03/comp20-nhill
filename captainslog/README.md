Almost all aspects of this program were implemented properly.
The one thing I forgot to do was get a timestap for each entry
and display that with my message. The method I used for iterating
through the local storage and retrieving/storing new entries
was not thought about with time stamp in mind. Adding the time
stamp to local storage would have required sufficient rearranging
of my javacsript and tbh it's a snowday and I can take the one 
point L. This project took me about 1.5 hours to complete and I 
did not collaborate with anybody.
